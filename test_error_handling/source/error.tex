\section{Introduction}

This document will fail to compile due to an intentional error.

Here is some normal text that compiles fine.

\section{Error Section}

This section contains an undefined command that will cause compilation to fail:

% Intentional error - undefined command
\thisCommandDoesNotExist{This will cause an error}

More text that would appear if the error didn't stop compilation.

\section{Conclusion}

This section should never render because of the error above.
