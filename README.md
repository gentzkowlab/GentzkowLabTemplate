This website is built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Development

### Preview as you write

MkDocs includes a live preview server, so you can preview your changes as you write your documentation. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving. Start it with:

```sh
mkdocs serve 
```
