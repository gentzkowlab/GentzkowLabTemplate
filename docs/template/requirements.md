The template requires that you have the ability to run Linux/MacOS shell (`.sh`) scripts. Windows users can run these scripts using a Windows Bash emulator such as [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

As an optional feature, we also recommend that you have Git LFS installed. This allows Git to store large binary files (including PDFs) efficiently. You can set up Git LFS following the instructions [here](https://github.com/gentzkow/GentzkowLabTemplate/tree/main/examples/git_lfs).

We also recommend setting up a project Google Drive to organize files related to the project. You can find a template structure for the Drive along with setup instructions [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1H09wDCePonKPsxSiQ3ZYVCnMKDKteFnQ).
